| [RAG in the Era of Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01666) | The paper revisits the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for long-context answer generation, despite the emergence of long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) that can incorporate longer text sequences. The authors argue that extremely long contexts in LLMs can lead to a diminished focus on relevant information and decreased answer quality.<br><br> Key Contributions: <br> &nbsp; - Proposal of an Order-Preserve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (OP-RAG) mechanism that improves RAG performance for long-context question-answer applications. <br> &nbsp; - Discovery of an inverted U-shaped curve, where answer quality initially rises and then declines as the number of retrieved chunks increases. <br> &nbsp; - Identification of "sweet points" where OP-RAG achieves higher answer quality with fewer tokens than long-context LLMs. <br><br> Main Claim: <br> &nbsp; The paper claims that OP-RAG can outperform long-context LLMs in certain scenarios, making it a viable solution for long-context answer generation. | RAG for long-context answer generation |
| [Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03271v1) | The paper addresses the instability of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in large language models (LLMs), which can lead to suboptimal reasoning performance. To overcome this, the authors propose the Strategic Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) methodology.<br><br> Key Contributions: <br> &nbsp; - SCoT integrates strategic knowledge to refine LLM performance by generating high-quality CoT paths and final answers.<br> &nbsp; - A two-stage approach is employed within a single prompt: eliciting an effective problem-solving strategy, followed by guided generation of CoT paths and final answers.<br> &nbsp; - Experimental results show significant improvements on eight challenging reasoning datasets, including a 21.05% increase on the GSM8K dataset and 24.13% on the Tracking Objects dataset.<br><br> Main Claim: <br> &nbsp; The paper claims that SCoT substantially enhances LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks, demonstrating its potential as a novel methodology for improving CoT methods. | Chain-of-Thought |
| [Large Language Model-Based Agents for Software Engineering: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02977) | The paper presents a comprehensive survey on Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents in the context of Software Engineering (SE). <br><br> Key Contributions: <br> &nbsp; - The survey collects and categorizes 106 papers on LLM-based agents for SE from two perspectives: SE and agent perspectives. <br> &nbsp; - The paper discusses the effectiveness of LLM-based agents in SE and their potential in tackling complex real-world problems through synergy with multiple agents and human interaction. <br> &nbsp; - The survey highlights open challenges and future directions in this critical domain. <br><br> Main Claim: <br> &nbsp; The paper aims to provide a systematic understanding of the current state of LLM-based agents in SE, identifying areas of promise and challenges for future research. <br><br> Additional Resource: <br> &nbsp; The survey's repository is available at https://github.com/FudanSELab/Agent4SE-Paper-List. | LLM Agents |
| [OLMoE: Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02060) | The paper introduces OLMOE, a state-of-the-art language model that leverages sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.<br><br> Key Contributions: <br> &nbsp; - OLMOE-1B-7B has 7 billion parameters but uses only 1 billion per input token, making it efficient. <br> &nbsp; - The model is pretrained on 5 trillion tokens and further adapted to create OLMOE-1B-7B-INSTRUCT. <br> &nbsp; - OLMOE outperforms other models with similar active parameters, including larger ones like Llama2-13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B.<br><br> Main Claim: <br> &nbsp; The paper claims that OLMOE is a highly efficient and effective language model that achieves state-of-the-art results while being fully open-sourced.  <br><br> Open-Source Resources: <br> &nbsp; - Model weights: https://hf.co/allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924 <br> &nbsp; - Training data: https://hf.co/datasets/allenai/OLMoE-mix-0924 <br> &nbsp; - Code: https://github.com/allenai/OLMoE <br> &nbsp; - Logs: https://wandb.ai/ai2-llm/olmoe/reports/| Mixture-of-Experts Language Models |
| [Beyond Preferences in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16984) | The paper challenges the dominant practice of AI alignment, which assumes that human preferences are an adequate representation of human values and that AI systems should be aligned with these preferences. The authors argue that this "preferentist approach" has limitations and propose alternative conceptual and technical frameworks for AI alignment.<br><br> Key Points: <br> &nbsp; - The paper critiques the use of rational choice theory and expected utility theory (EUT) as a basis for AI alignment, arguing that they fail to capture the complexity of human values and neglect the possibility of incommensurable values. <br> &nbsp; - The authors propose a reframing of AI alignment, where AI systems are aligned with normative standards appropriate to their social roles, rather than with human preferences. <br> &nbsp; - This alternative approach emphasizes the importance of negotiating and agreeing upon normative standards with all relevant stakeholders, allowing for a multiplicity of AI systems to serve diverse ends while promoting mutual benefit and limiting harm.<br><br> Main Claim: <br> &nbsp; The paper argues that the preferentist approach to AI alignment is inadequate and that a new framework is needed to ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and promote beneficial outcomes. | Beyond Preference in AI Alignment  |
