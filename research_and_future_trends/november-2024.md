| [Distinguishing Ignorance from Error in LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22071) | 🔍 The Challenge: Ignorance vs. Error - This recent study introduces the concept of two hallucination types: <br> &nbsp; 🚫 Lack of Knowledge (HK-): When the model simply doesn't know the answer <br> &nbsp; ⚠️ Despite Knowledge (HK+): When the model gives wrong answers despite knowing the correct information! <br> <br> This distinction is critical, as each type requires different interventions. For HK-, external information is necessary, while HK+ errors can potentially be corrected by adjusting the model's internal logic. 🧠 <br> <br>Researchers also introduced WACK (Wrong Answers despite having Correct Knowledge), a novel approach to create model-specific datasets that help distinguish between these types of hallucinations. 🎯 <br> <br>🔑 Key findings:  <br> &nbsp; ✨ Different AI models have unique "knowledge fingerprints" and hallucination patterns  <br> &nbsp; 🎓 Model-specific datasets outperform generic ones in detecting hallucinations  <br> &nbsp; 🔮 It's possible to predict potential hallucinations BEFORE they happen! | Hallucinations |
| [Nearest Neighbor Normalization Improves Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24114) | This new paper proposes an ingenious solution called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN) - The key idea is to estimate and correct for bias in each retrieval candidate, using only the k nearest neighbours from a reference dataset.  <br> <br> 🔑 This simple yet effective technique provides a few key benefits: <br> &nbsp; ✅ Consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy across a range of state-of-the-art models and datasets 📈 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Significant reductions in gender bias for image retrieval 🌐 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Efficient implementation using vector search, making it practical for real-world use 🚀 <br> <br> The authors demonstrate NNN can match the performance of finetuning the models, but with no additional training required.

| [Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08028) | According to this recent paper from researchers at Georgia Tech, Stanford, and the University of Hong Kong, even SOTA models like GPT-4 can be easily fooled by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups. <br> <br> 🔑 Key findings: <br> &nbsp; 💥 Over 80% of the time, the AI agents clicked on the malicious pop-ups instead of completing their intended tasks. This led to significant decreases in their overall task success rates. <br> &nbsp; 🕸️ The attackers used a variety of techniques to grab the agents' attention, including summarizing the user's query, using fake virus alerts, and speculating the user's intent. <br> &nbsp; 🛡️ Basic defence strategies like asking the agents to ignore pop-ups were largely ineffective. The agents struggled to distinguish legitimate UI elements from the adversarial ones. <br> <br> This highlights the critical need for AI systems to develop true understanding and reasoning, not just superficial pattern matching. Without it, they remain vulnerable to even simple visual tricks. | VLMs |

| [Toward Optimal Search and Retrieval for RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07396) | 🤔 Imagine you’re searching for critical information in a vast digital library. You need accuracy, but you also need speed. Every extra second counts, yet so does every relevant document you pull. <br><br> This balance is the challenge facing RAG systems today.<br><br> This recent study delves into improving just that, specifically focusing on optimizing the retriever component in search tasks for effective QA. <br><br> 🔑 Key insights: <br> &nbsp; 🔍 More isn't always better: Performance plateaus at 10-20 retrieved documents for most tasks. Adding more can actually hurt performance! <br> &nbsp;  ⚡️ Speed vs Accuracy trade-off: Here's something exciting - lowering search accuracy in RAG systems has minimal impact on performance while potentially boosting retrieval speed and memory efficiency.  <br> &nbsp;  💡 Gold standard matters: Including just ONE relevant "gold" document significantly improves accuracy. Each additional relevant document steadily increases performance. <br> &nbsp;  🎯 Practical takeaway: Focus on retrieving highly relevant documents rather than just more documents. Quality > Quantity. | RAG |
