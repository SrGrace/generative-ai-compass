| [Distinguishing Ignorance from Error in LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22071) | 🔍 The Challenge: Ignorance vs. Error - This recent study introduces the concept of two hallucination types: <br> &nbsp; 🚫 Lack of Knowledge (HK-): When the model simply doesn't know the answer <br> &nbsp; ⚠️ Despite Knowledge (HK+): When the model gives wrong answers despite knowing the correct information! <br> <br> This distinction is critical, as each type requires different interventions. For HK-, external information is necessary, while HK+ errors can potentially be corrected by adjusting the model's internal logic. 🧠 <br> <br>Researchers also introduced WACK (Wrong Answers despite having Correct Knowledge), a novel approach to create model-specific datasets that help distinguish between these types of hallucinations. 🎯 <br> <br>🔑 Key findings:  <br> &nbsp; ✨ Different AI models have unique "knowledge fingerprints" and hallucination patterns  <br> &nbsp; 🎓 Model-specific datasets outperform generic ones in detecting hallucinations  <br> &nbsp; 🔮 It's possible to predict potential hallucinations BEFORE they happen! | Hallucinations |
| [Nearest Neighbor Normalization Improves Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24114) | This new paper proposes an ingenious solution called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN) - The key idea is to estimate and correct for bias in each retrieval candidate, using only the k nearest neighbours from a reference dataset.  <br> <br> 🔑 This simple yet effective technique provides a few key benefits: <br> &nbsp; ✅ Consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy across a range of state-of-the-art models and datasets 📈 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Significant reductions in gender bias for image retrieval 🌐 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Efficient implementation using vector search, making it practical for real-world use 🚀 <br> <br> The authors demonstrate NNN can match the performance of finetuning the models, but with no additional training required.

| [Multi-expert Prompting Improves Reliability, Safety and Usefulness of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00492) | This new study introduces Multi-Expert Prompting - an approach that simulates multiple expert perspectives to improve the quality of LLM responses. <br> <br> 🆕 What's new? <br> &nbsp; 🔹 Instead of relying on a single "expert," this technique generates multiple expert viewpoints on a topic, simulating a panel of specialists.  <br> &nbsp; 🔹 By integrating their insights and selecting the most comprehensive response, this method avoids biases and broadens the scope of the answers. <br> &nbsp; 🔹 The process is inspired by decision-making models, ensuring that each "expert" has a unique, valuable perspective. <br> <br> 🔑 Some key highlights: <br> &nbsp; ✅ Outperforms SOTA methods by up to 8.69% on truthfulness benchmarks  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Completely eliminates toxic content and reduces hurtfulness  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Generates 75% more informative and 76.5% more useful responses compared to leading baselines  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Maintains transparency and explainability through a 7-step aggregation process | Prompting |
| [Attacking Vision-Language Computer Agents via Pop-ups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08028) | According to this recent paper from researchers at Georgia Tech, Stanford, and the University of Hong Kong, even SOTA models like GPT-4 can be easily fooled by carefully designed adversarial pop-ups. <br> <br> 🔑 Key findings: <br> &nbsp; 💥 Over 80% of the time, the AI agents clicked on the malicious pop-ups instead of completing their intended tasks. This led to significant decreases in their overall task success rates. <br> &nbsp; 🕸️ The attackers used a variety of techniques to grab the agents' attention, including summarizing the user's query, using fake virus alerts, and speculating the user's intent. <br> &nbsp; 🛡️ Basic defence strategies like asking the agents to ignore pop-ups were largely ineffective. The agents struggled to distinguish legitimate UI elements from the adversarial ones. <br> <br> This highlights the critical need for AI systems to develop true understanding and reasoning, not just superficial pattern matching. Without it, they remain vulnerable to even simple visual tricks. | VLMs |
| [A Comprehensive Survey of Small Language Models in the Era of Large Language Models: Techniques, Enhancements, Applications, Collaboration with LLMs, and Trustworthiness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03350) | LLMs have undoubtedly revolutionized text generation, reasoning, and even specialized domains like healthcare and law.  <br> <br> However, their massive parameter sizes and computational demands bring certain challenges: <br> &nbsp; 💰 High operational costs <br> &nbsp; 🔒 Privacy concerns with cloud APIs <br> &nbsp; ⏰ Limited real-time capabilities <br> &nbsp; 🏥 Domain-specific limitations <br> <br> Enter Small Language Models (SLMs) - the game-changers that are:  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Cost-effective  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Privacy-friendly  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Perfect for edge devices  <br> &nbsp; ✅ Easily customizable for specific domains <br> <br> Think of SLMs as the "specialists" of the AI world - lean, efficient, and purpose-built for specific tasks. They're proving that you don't need billions of parameters to make a big impact! 💡 | SLMs Survey |
