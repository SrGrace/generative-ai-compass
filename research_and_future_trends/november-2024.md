| [Distinguishing Ignorance from Error in LLM Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22071) | 🔍 The Challenge: Ignorance vs. Error - This recent study introduces the concept of two hallucination types: <br> &nbsp; 🚫 Lack of Knowledge (HK-): When the model simply doesn't know the answer <br> &nbsp; ⚠️ Despite Knowledge (HK+): When the model gives wrong answers despite knowing the correct information! <br> <br> This distinction is critical, as each type requires different interventions. For HK-, external information is necessary, while HK+ errors can potentially be corrected by adjusting the model's internal logic. 🧠 <br> <br>Researchers also introduced WACK (Wrong Answers despite having Correct Knowledge), a novel approach to create model-specific datasets that help distinguish between these types of hallucinations. 🎯 <br> <br>🔑 Key findings:  <br> &nbsp; ✨ Different AI models have unique "knowledge fingerprints" and hallucination patterns  <br> &nbsp; 🎓 Model-specific datasets outperform generic ones in detecting hallucinations  <br> &nbsp; 🔮 It's possible to predict potential hallucinations BEFORE they happen! | Hallucinations |
| [Nearest Neighbor Normalization Improves Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24114) | This new paper proposes an ingenious solution called Nearest Neighbor Normalization (NNN) - The key idea is to estimate and correct for bias in each retrieval candidate, using only the k nearest neighbours from a reference dataset.  <br> <br> 🔑 This simple yet effective technique provides a few key benefits: <br> &nbsp; ✅ Consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy across a range of state-of-the-art models and datasets 📈 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Significant reductions in gender bias for image retrieval 🌐 <br> &nbsp; ✅ Efficient implementation using vector search, making it practical for real-world use 🚀 <br> <br> The authors demonstrate NNN can match the performance of finetuning the models, but with no additional training required. Really clever stuff! 👏 | Multimodal Retrieval improvement |
