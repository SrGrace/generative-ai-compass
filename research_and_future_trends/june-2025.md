| [Topology of Reasoning: Understanding Large Reasoning Models through Reasoning Graph Properties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05744) | Want better reasoning from LLMs? Study their paths, not just their outputs. <br><br>Most people tune prompts. <br> Some tune data. <br>This paper asks: what if we study how a model thinks, not just what it says? <br><br>That’s where reasoning graphs come in. <br><br>🧩 Reasoning isn't a straight line. <br> It's a graph with nodes for each reasoning step, and edges showing how the model moves through them. <br><br>And when researchers plotted these graphs, they noticed something: <br><br>✅ Better models think in cycles. <br>  They revisit their own steps. Pause. Reconsider. <br>  Just like we do when we catch a mistake mid-sentence. <br><br>✅ They explore more. <br>  Graph diameters were much larger for high-performing models. <br>  They search wider. Try more paths. Think longer before answering. <br><br>✅ Their graphs show small-world patterns. <br>  Dense local clusters. Long-range connections. <br>  That means: efficient, yet thorough reasoning. <br><br>✅✅ Even cooler: <br>  These structures emerge naturally in models trained on good SFT data. <br>  No special prompt. No custom loss function. <br>  Just better data. Tracked through the shape of thought. <br><br>So here's a thought: <br>  What if we judged reasoning quality not by BLEU scores, but by graph shape? <br><br>What if dataset design included: <br>  “Does this make the model rethink?” <br>  “Does this make it explore more paths?” <br><br>This paper gives a new perspective -  <br>  Not just: “Did the model get it right?” <br>  But: “How did it get there?” <br><br>And that shift might matter more than we think. | LLM Reasoning |
