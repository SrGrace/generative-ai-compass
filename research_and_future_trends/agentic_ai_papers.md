| [AI Agents That Matter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01502) | The paper discusses the current state of AI agent benchmarks and highlights several issues that limit their real-world applicability: <br><br> &nbsp; - Narrow Focus on Accuracy: Current benchmarks emphasize accuracy, neglecting other important metrics like cost. This has led to overly complex and expensive state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. <br> &nbsp; - Cost-Accuracy Optimization: The authors propose optimizing both cost and accuracy, demonstrating that itâ€™s possible to reduce costs significantly while maintaining accuracy. <br> &nbsp; - Conflated Benchmarking Needs: The needs of model developers and downstream application developers are mixed, making it difficult to choose the best agent for specific applications. <br> &nbsp; - Inadequate Holdout Sets: Many benchmarks lack proper holdout sets, causing agents to overfit and become fragile. <br> &nbsp; - Lack of Standardization: There is a lack of standardized evaluation practices, leading to poor reproducibility. <br><br>The authors suggest a framework to address these issues, aiming to develop agents that are not only accurate on benchmarks but also useful in real-world applications. | AI Agents | July 2024 |
