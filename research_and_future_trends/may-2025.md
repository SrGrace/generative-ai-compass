| [Rethinking Memory in AI: Taxonomy, Operations, Topics, and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00675) | There are three types of memory in AI systems:<br> &nbsp; 1> Parametric memory (baked into model weights)<br> &nbsp;  2> Contextual structured memory (like graphs or DBs)<br> &nbsp;  3> Contextual unstructured memory (raw chat logs, images, videos, etc.) <br><br> But most current systems lean heavily on just one or two. That’s like asking a human to operate with half a brain. <br><br> Even more interesting are the 6 memory operations that intelligent agents must perform:<br> &nbsp; 1> Consolidation – Convert fleeting context into long-term memory<br> &nbsp;  2> Indexing – Label and organize info for fast access<br> &nbsp;  3> Updating – Modify memory when new info arrives<br> &nbsp;  4> Forgetting – Remove irrelevant or stale knowledge<br> &nbsp;  5> Retrieval – Pull the right memory at the right time<br> &nbsp;  6> Compression – Shrink memory while keeping what matters <br><br> Now ask yourself: how many LLM agents today can actually do all six? <br><br> Answer: Almost none. <br><br> Most LLM agents today just extend context windows and call that “memory.” <br><br> But that’s like saying a bigger backpack is the same as a better brain. <br><br> If we want long-term, useful agents—whether for personal assistants, co-pilots, or autonomous decision-makers—we need memory systems that actively learn what to keep and what to forget. <br><br> So what’s next?<br> &nbsp;  ✅ Memory needs to span multiple modalities: text, image, video<br> &nbsp;  ✅ It needs to evolve over time—learning patterns, updating beliefs<br> &nbsp;  ✅ And maybe most importantly, we’ll need multi-agent shared memory systems, where agents learn from each other’s experiences | Memory |
