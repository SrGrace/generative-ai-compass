| [CRAG - Comprehensive RAG Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04744) | The Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG) addresses the limitations of existing RAG datasets by providing a diverse and dynamic set of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs for simulating web and Knowledge Graph searches. CRAG evaluates LLMs' QA capabilities across various domains and question categories, revealing that even state-of-the-art RAG solutions struggle with accuracy, especially on questions with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity. The benchmark has already fostered significant engagement, paving the way for future research and improvements in RAG and general QA solutions. | RAG Evaluation | June 2024 |
