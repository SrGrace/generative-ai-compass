### We have a 200K token context window. How would you design an application that actually leverages this effectively?
---

You: "Large context is powerful but has challenges: cost, latency, lost in the middle problem. I'd use it strategically, not universally."

Interviewer: "What do you mean by strategically?"

You: "Let me explain the key considerations:"
The Cost Reality:
 - 200K token input ~ $2-4 per call 
 - For a user-facing app with 10K daily users, unoptimized context usage could cost $20-40K/day

The Performance Reality:
 - Linear attention is still O(n^2) memory for full attention
 - Latency increases with context length
 - Quality degradation in middle sections (known research limitation)

You continue: "So I'd architect a tiered context strategy:"
 - Tier 1 - Core (Always): System prompt, last 10 turns, business logic (~8-15K)
 - Tier 2 - Dynamic: Vector search results, retrieved history (~30-70K) 
 - Tier 3 - Bulk (When Needed): Full documents, transcripts (50-200K)

Interviewer: "How'd you decide what goes in each tier?"

You: "Through a multi-stage routing system:
 - Stage 1 - Intent Classification: Simple Q&A vs complex reasoning?
 - Stage 2 - Retrieval: Top 3-5 chunks for simple, top 20+ for complex
 - Stage 3 - Context Packing: Important info at start/end, less critical in middle
 - Stage 4 - Adaptive Truncation: Remove Tier 3 if hitting budget limits"

Interviewer: "The lost in the middle problem?"

You: "This is critical. 

Mitigation:
 - Positional Emphasis: Use XML tags to highlight key sections: 
<most_relevant> </most_relevant>; [Middle content]; <also_relevant> </also_relevant>
 - Explicit Pointers: 'Answer is in section marked CRITICAL_INFO'
 - Multi-Pass: Identify relevant sections first, then zoom in
 - Summarization Layers: Give model the map before territory"

Interviewer: "How'd you measure if long context helps?"

You: "A/B test three architectures:
 - Baseline (8K RAG): Fast, cheap, 75% accuracy
 - Extended (32K RAG): 2x cost, 85% accuracy
 - Full Doc (200K): 10x cost, 90% accuracy
Metrics: Accuracy, latency (P95), cost per query, user satisfaction
Goal: Maximum accuracy per $ spent."

Interviewer: "When'd you actually use the full 200K?"

You: "Only for specific, high-value use cases:
 - Legal contract analysis
 - Codebase refactoring 
 - Multi-hour meeting synthesis 
 - Research literature review
NOT for: 
 - Simple Q&A, chatbot conversations, basic summarization"
