### Your multi-agent system keeps producing conflicting results - one agent summarizes, another contradicts. What's wrong?
---

You: "That's an orchestration failure.
 Multi-agent setups are like teams - they need coordination, not chaos."

Interviewer: "So it's not about more agents - it’s about better communication?"

You: "Exactly.
 Without a coordination layer, agents overlap, rework, or argue endlessly.
 Each agent must have:
 - A clear role (planner, retriever, summarizer, verifier).
 - A shared memory space (so they know what’s already done).
 - A controller that decides task flow and merges outputs."

Interviewer: "What does a good orchestration loop look like?"

You: "Think of it as a project manager AI:
 1. Planner breaks the main goal into subtasks.
 2. Specialist agents execute each step.
 3. Reviewer agent checks consistency.
 4. Controller validates and composes the final output."

Interviewer: "So coordination replaces complexity?"

You: "Yep.
 One well-managed team beats eleven brilliant individuals.
 Same for agents - collaboration beats computation."
