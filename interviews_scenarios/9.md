### Why does chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improve LLM performance on complex tasks - but sometimes fails catastrophically?
---

You pause - most jump to "more tokens = better reasoning."

You reply:
 - CoT exposes intermediate reasoning steps -> model can self-correct.
 - But it increases context length, so early reasoning steps may dominate attention.
 - Errors propagate: a small misstep in the first few steps gets amplified downstream.

The interviewer probes:
"How do you prevent error compounding?"

You explain:
 - Use stepwise verification - each CoT step validated against external knowledge or rules.
 - Apply modular CoT: break problems into smaller reasoning subgraphs instead of one long chain.
 - Introduce attention recalibration: periodically rescale attention to newer, more relevant tokens.

Finally, you add:
"Chain-of-thought works best when the model treats each step as immutable evidence, not just context for prediction."
