### 2. Your embedding lookups are painfully slow. What’s going on, and how do you fix it?
---

Most say, "We need bigger GPUs."
Wrong. 

The real problem? 
Sparse access patterns and poor caching.
 - Embedding tables are huge - millions of rows. Each batch touches only a fraction.
 - Dense matrix multiplications compute everything, even rows you don’t need.

Solution: Smart indexing + caching + block-wise multiplication
 - Preload frequently accessed rows into GPU memory
 - Cache hot rows to avoid repeated CPU -> GPU transfers
 - Multiply only the blocks that are actually used

Result? 
 - 2–3x faster embedding lookups, 
 - lower memory usage, and 
 - no additional GPUs needed.
