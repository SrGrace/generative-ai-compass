### We're building autonomous agents for complex, multi-step reasoning over extended periods. How do you tackle the long-term memory problem beyond just increasing context window size?
---

This is how you answer.

You know the context window is a temporary fix. For true long-term memory, an external, dynamic, and structured memory system is key...describe a blend of episodic and semantic memory.

You: "An LLM's context window isn't enough. We need an external memory system, combining episodic and semantic approaches."

Interviewer: "Break that down. What are these memory types and how do they interact?"

You: "Think of it like human memory:"

1. Episodic Memory (Experiences):
 - Purpose: Stores specific past events (actions, observations, outcomes) in chronological order. The 'what happened when.'
 - Implementation: A log of structured tuples (timestamp, action, observation). Can be a simple database or a vector store for semantic search over experiences.

2. Semantic Memory (Knowledge & Skills):
 - Purpose: Stores generalized knowledge, learned facts, successful strategies. The 'what I know' and 'how to do things.'
 - Implementation: Primarily a vector database for facts, perhaps a knowledge graph for relationships, and a 'skill library' of reusable sub-routines.

Interviewer: "How does the agent decide what to store and retrieve?"

You: "The LLM orchestrates this, but with explicit processes:"

1. Encoding: The LLM summarizes observations/actions into concise memory chunks. A 'reflection' module can periodically synthesize new semantic knowledge from episodic memories.

2. Retrieval (Recall):
 - The LLM generates a memory query based on its current goal.
 - This query searches the vector database (semantic) or structured log (episodic).
 - The LLM then re-ranks retrieved memories for relevance before integrating them into its prompt.

3. Forgetting/Consolidation: Important to manage growth. Strategies include:
 - Recency bias, importance weighting (LLM-assigned scores).
 - Consolidating old episodic memories into new semantic entries to reduce redundancy.

Interviewer: "What's the biggest challenge here for a model like Claude?"

You: "Ensuring the LLM effectively uses retrieved memory, rather than being overwhelmed. It must learn when to consult memory and what type to query. This involves fine-tuning the LLM on meta-cognitive tasks - teaching it to manage its own knowledge."
