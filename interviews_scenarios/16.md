### We want to build an autonomous agent system that can handle complex customer returns involving multiple departments. How would you architect this?
---

This is how you answer...

You: "For multi-departmental coordination with real business impact, we need a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with clear boundaries, not a single monolithic agent."

Interviewer: "Why multiple agents? Wouldn't that add complexity?"

You: "Not really. Let me explain the critical design points here:"
Core Requirements:
 - Reliability: Can't have agents hallucinating refund amounts
 - Coordination: Need to check inventory, billing, shipping status
 - Explainability: Must audit every decision for compliance
 - Fault Tolerance: Partial failures shouldn't crash the entire flow
 - Scalability: Handle 100K+ queries daily

You (on Architecture): "I'd design a hierarchical system:
Layer 1 - Orchestrator Agent
 - GPT-4 for reasoning about intent
 - Decomposes requests into subtasks
 - Routes to specialized agents
Layer 2 - Specialized Agents
 - Inventory Agent: Product availability
 - Billing Agent: Payment, refunds
 - Shipping Agent: Package tracking
 - Policy Agent: Return policies
Layer 3 - Tool Execution
 - Deterministic API calls to actual systems
 - Database queries with proper error handling
 - External service integrations"

Interviewer: "How'd you prevent the agents from making costly mistakes?"

You: "I'd implement multiple safeguards:
1. Constrained Action Space
 - Agents can only call pre-approved APIs
 - All external calls go through a validation layer
2. Human-in-the-Loop for High Stakes
 - Refunds >$$ require approval
 - Policy exceptions flagged for review
 - Confidence scoring on every decision
3. Structured Outputs
 - Force JSON responses with schema validation
 - Range validation (refund amount <=> original purchase)
4. Audit Trail
 - Log every agent decision
 - Store reasoning chains
 - Enable replay for debugging
5. Circuit Breakers
 - Rate limits per agent type
 - Automatic fallback to human support
 - Kill switch for anomalous behavior"

Interviewer: "What about the communication protocol?"

You: "I'd use a message bus architecture:
Orchestrator -> Task Queue -> Specialized Agents -> Result Queue -> Orchestrator
Each message includes:
 - Task ID for tracing
 - Context and constraints
 - Timeout parameters
Decouples agents for independent testing."

Interviewer: "How would you evaluate this system before production?"

You: "Multi-layered evaluation strategy:
 - Unit Tests: Each agent isolated
 - Integration Tests: Full workflow in staging
 - Safety Red Teaming: Adversarial prompts
 - Shadow Mode: Run parallel to humans
 - Gradual Rollout: Start 1%, A/B test
