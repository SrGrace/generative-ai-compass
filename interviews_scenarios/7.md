### We're serving billions of LLM inference requests daily across various applications. What caching strategies are you thinking about to maximize throughput and minimize latency?
---

This is how you answer ...

You: "For billions of requests at Meta scale, caching is non-negotiable. I'd propose a multi-layered caching strategy targeting both prompt engineering and generation outputs, spanning different parts of the inference pipeline."

Interviewer: "Multi-layered? Elaborate."

You: "Absolutely. We can cache at several points:"

1. Prompt Cache (Input-level):
 - What: Caches identical input prompts + their full generated outputs.
 - When: For very frequent, exact queries (e.g., common system prompts, greetings).
 - Mechanism: High-throughput KV store (Redis). Hash of prompt as key.
 - Benefit: Bypasses LLM entirely, near-instant response.

2. Prefix/KV Cache (Intermediate-level):
 - What: Caches Key/Value states from common prompt prefixes.
 - When: Critical for applications with shared prompt beginnings (e.g., 'Translate this:', 'Summarize:').
 - Mechanism: Implemented within the LLM serving framework (like vLLM's PagedAttention).
 - Benefit: Avoids recomputing attention for the prefix, speeding up initial token generation, reduces VRAM.

3. Response Cache (Output-level):
 - What: Caches final generated responses, potentially after post-processing.
 - When: For stable, deterministically generated outputs (e.g., specific summarization tasks).
 - Mechanism: Similar to prompt cache.
 - Benefit: Ensures consistency, avoids re-running post-processing.

Interviewer: "What about cache invalidation and consistency?"

You: "Critical challenge for large-scale caching."
 - TTL (Time-To-Live): Most caches would have a TTL for entries, especially for dynamic content.
 - Event-Driven Invalidation: If underlying data changes (e.g., a knowledge base update for RAG), we could trigger invalidation of relevant cache entries.
 - Deterministic Hashing: For prompt/response caches, a robust hashing strategy for prompts is key.
 - Staleness Tolerance: For some applications, a slight degree of staleness might be acceptable for the sake of throughput.

Interviewer: "How do you integrate this efficiently into Meta's infrastructure?"

You: "We'd leverage our existing distributed caching layers and potentially build custom proxy services that sit in front of the LLM serving endpoints. Telemetry on cache hit rates and latency improvements would be paramount to optimize these strategies."

Interviewer: Nods!

This comprehensive approach is fundamental to operating LLMs efficiently and affordably at massive scale.
